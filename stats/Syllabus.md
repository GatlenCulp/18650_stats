18.650 - Fundamentals of Statistics
Welcome to the Spring 2026 offering of 18.650, Course 18’s largest and most advanced statistics class! We will cover a broad range of statistical ideas at a brisk pace. Our main text is Larry Wasserman’s All of Statistics (hereafter “the book”). The title is somewhat ambitious, but it will often feel accurate.

This is a theoretical statistics course with a strong emphasis on why and when methods work. Following the course will require a reasonable level of mathematical maturity (see Prerequisites below).

All announcements and discussions will take place on PiazzaLinks to an external site..

Course Learning Objectives
This course offers a fast-paced tour of core statistical concepts, including estimation, hypothesis testing, regression (parametric and non-parametric), and several more advanced topics often omitted from introductory courses (e.g., causal inference, classification, survival analysis).

By the end of the course, you should be able to:

Formulate a statistical model from a real-world problem.
Understand the role of mathematics in the design and analysis of statistical methods.
Select appropriate statistical methods for a given problem.
Evaluate the assumptions, implications, and limitations of various methods.
Take an ML class and actually understand what is happening “under the hood.”
Crush the statistics portion of technical interviews (e.g., hedge funds, data science).
Prerequisites
You are expected to have taken an introductory course in probability and to know basic linear algebra.

More specifically:

Calculus I (GIR)
Probability at the level of 18.600 or 6.041. (In a nutshell, we will assume you are comfortable with the first three chapters of the book.)
Linear algebra fundamentals (vectors, matrices, orthogonality, inner products, etc.)
To help you assess your preparation, Problem Set 1 is a review of key probability concepts used throughout the semester. If you find Pset 1 difficult, you should spend some time studying the first three chapters of the book.

Lectures
Time: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 1:00–2:00 pm
Location: 2-190
Lectures will be taught on the beautiful blackboards of 2-190, with the book as the main reading. Lectures aim to highlight key concepts, show how they fit together, and provide intuition. Given the pace, not all details will be covered in class; you are expected to learn additional details from the book and from recitations. You are strongly encouraged to take notes during lecture.

Lecture recordings
Lectures will be recorded and posted on Canvas as soon as processing allows. While we make every effort to record all lectures, technical problems may occur. Recordings are a supplementary resource, not a substitute for attendance. In the rare case that a video is missing, the teaching staff cannot guarantee additional resources beyond regular materials. Your in-person attendance is therefore highly encouraged.

Tentative Course Schedule
We will do our best to adhere to this schedule, but some adjustments may be necessary, especially for newer material.

Office Hours
Office hours are an important component of the course. All members of the teaching team will hold in-person office hours and will also interact on Piazza.

For advice on how to use office hours effectively, see this pageLinks to an external site..

Office hours schedule
Mon	11am–12pm	Julia Kozak	2-142
Tue	4–5pm	Aleksander Zimin	2-142
Wed	11am–12pm	Cedric Kamkoum	2-147
Wed	2–3pm	Mohammad Reza Karimi	2-103
Thu	11am–12pm	Hang Du	2-136
Fri	3–4pm	Gracie Sheng	2-143
Recitations
Each student is assigned to a recitation section when enrolling in the class. Recitations are an integral part of the course and should be treated like lectures. They focus on developing problem-solving skills and are taught by the TAs.

Section 1	Thursdays 1-2 pm	4-270	Cedric Kamkoum
Section 2	Thursdays 3-4 pm	4-153	Aleksander Zimin
There will be no office hours and no recitations during the first week of class.

Reading
The textbook is an essential component of the course. You may even bring the book to the final exam (see Tests and Exam for details).

The book is reasonably priced (starting around $40 new). It is also available for free through SpringerLink (PDF) via the MIT Libraries. If you choose to print your own copy for the exam, it must be a bound copy. Loose pages are not allowed and will be confiscated. (A bound copy of a book is one that is permanently held together by a binding method such as hardcover, softcover, etc.).

Larry Wasserman. All of Statistics. Springer, 2004.

(All editions are effectively equivalent for our purposes; use whichever is most convenient.)

Grading
Because of the breadth of material, it is crucial to keep up throughout the term. To help you monitor your progress, there will be three in-class tests and regular homework assignments.

Homework	40%	Four PSets to be turned in via Gradescope
Midterms	30%	3 in-class tests (see dates below)
Final	30%	TBA.
Additional credit: You can earn additional points on your final exam score by answering classmates’ questions on Piazza. For every 10 endorsed answers, you receive 1 additional point on your final exam. The final exam score after bonuses is capped at 100.

Exam make-ups
There is no policy of dropping the lowest midterm grade. Missed exams require appropriate documentation and will be replaced with an oral make-up examination. Exam make-ups are offered as needed to students who miss them for reasons that are non-arbitrary, unavoidable, and/or beyond the student’s control such as illness, personal crisis, or family emergency. You can reach out to the instructor directly via email in this case.

Homework
There will be four problem sets during the semester. Pset 1 Reviews probability background. Use it to diagnose any gaps in prerequisite material. The other three PSets focus on mastering course content. They are not meant as direct “mock exams,” but rather as deeper practice where you can take time to write complete solutions. Some problems may be adapted from recent technical/hedge-fund interviews to illustrate practical relevance.

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates, but verbatim copying is strictly forbidden. On each submission, please list the names of any collaborators.

As a rule of thumb, you should be able to explain your reasoning during a meeting. Each student must produce their own write-up, in their own words, and be able to explain their solutions if asked. You should also explain as much as possible of your reasoning when solving a problem. You should certainly ask the instructor or TAs for help with the homework problems, but first make a serious attempt on each problem before seeking help.

Questions about homework grading should be addressed on Gradescope. If the issue is not resolved, you may then discuss it with the instructor.

You may use the PSet Partners matching tool or Piazza to find partners.

Homeworks are due on Gradescope by 11:59 pm Eastern Time on the due date.

Pset 1: Wednesday, Feb. 18
Pset 2: Wednesday, Mar. 11
Pset 3: Wednesday, Apr. 8
Pset 4: Wednesday, May. 6
Late homework policy
You are allowed a total of 4 late days across the semester, subject to:

At most 2 late days per Pset, so that we can release solutions on Friday.
Late days are counted in full-day increments based on the submission timestamp. For example:
Submitted on Thursday → 1 day late
Submitted on Friday → 2 days late
Submitted after Friday → not accepted; receives a grade of 0

Manage your late days carefully. Late submissions outside this policy will not be accepted, even in most emergency situations. Extraordinary circumstances (e.g., extended illness) will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Tests and Exam
There will be four timed exams: three in-class midterms and one final exam during the official exam period. The in-class tests will last for the duration of the lecture (starting at 1:05pm, ending at 1:55pm). The first exam will take place in Walker 50-340. The next two exams will take place in 26-100.

Midterm dates
Midterm 1: Monday, Feb. 23 (in Walker 50-340)
Midterm 2: Friday, Mar. 20 (in 26-100)
Midterm 3: Friday, Apr. 24 (in 26-100)
The final exam date will be announced once determined by the registrar.

All exams are closed notes. You may bring one double-sided letter-sized cheat sheet to each midterm and to the final. You may also bring the class textbook (All of Statistics) only to the final exam, not to the midterms. No additional notes (handwritten or typed) are allowed other than the cheat sheet.

Piazza Discussion Forum
We use PiazzaLinks to an external site. for course communication and Q&A.

Piazza should be used instead of email for most course-related questions (except private or personal matters). Students are expected not only to ask questions but also to answer them. Good answers will be endorsed by the teaching staff, and this participation may lead to additional credit (see Grading).

How to use Piazza
Piazza is the main way for you to communicate with the course team and other students. Here are some guidelines to help you successfully navigate and interact on the Piazza forum:

Use Piazza when working through lecture material, recitation problems, or readings.
Use LaTeX formatting for mathematical expressions ($$...$$).
Use informative titles and appropriate tags so others can easily find relevant threads.
Be very specific: Which problem or concept are you asking about? What exactly is confusing? What have you tried so far? A descriptive title helps others with the same issue find your question.
Academic integrity: Collaboration is encouraged, but please do not ask for or post problem set solutions.
Upvote helpful questions and answers to improve visibility.
You may ask or answer anonymously, if you prefer.
Search before posting. Use the search bar so that related discussions are consolidated and easier to follow.
Write clearly. Avoid ALL CAPS, abbrv of wrds (abbreviating words), and excessive punctuation!!!!
Please be courteous and constructive in all posts. Curtness under anonymty will not be tolerated.
This syllabus is subject to minor adjustments; any changes will be announced on Piazza. [Writing center]
